I decided to make a game for DOS! Using Turbo C++ 3.0, just like I used to do way too many years ago in high school.

It's a clone of Matricks, originally for the TI-85 calculator by Dan Eble: https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/7/737.html

The goal of the game is to make the two sides match. Every time you move from one space to another of a different color, it changes the color of the destination (to the third color). See how few moves it takes to make them match!
